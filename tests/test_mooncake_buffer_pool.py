"""Pooled receive buffers on the MooncakeStore tensor read path.

The store and the buffer pool are faked, so these tests need neither mooncake nor RDMA.
The fake pool keeps the upstream properties this path depends on: buffers are carved out
of one fixed arena and reused, exhaustion raises, a buffer cannot be returned while an
exported view of it is alive, and the pool cannot close while a buffer is out on loan.
